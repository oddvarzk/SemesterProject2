Semester Project Exam for my 3rd Semester at Noroff.
Some functionality not complete, struggled my way threw.
Installing the project

Clone the repo:
Open VS Code
git https://github.com/oddvarzk/SemesterProject-2.git

To run the website, do the following:

Run npm run build to setup tailwind and you are good to go!

Have Live Server installed on your VS Code, and right click the index.html page and press Open with Live Server and you are good to go!
